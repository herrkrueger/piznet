# Simple Keywords (easy to add/change)
# IMPORTANT: Keywords are USER-PROVIDED - users fill these categories with specific terms
# System searches ALL THREE stages and tracks which combinations get hits in PATSTAT/OPS
keywords:
  # Primary technology terms
  primary: 
    #- "technology"

  # Specific focus areas (customize as needed)
  focus:
    #- "advanced"
    #- "novel"

# CPC Classifications (only CPC, no IPC)
# IMPORTANT: User selects technology area symbols - system searches ALL codes for that area
